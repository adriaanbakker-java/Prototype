git clone --filter from git 2.19 now works on GitHub (tested 2020-09-18, git 2.25.1)

This option was added together with an update to the remote protocol, and it truly prevents objects from being downloaded from the server.

E.g., to clone only objects required for d1 of this repository: https://github.com/cirosantilli/test-git-partial-clone I can do:

git clone \
  --depth 1 \
  --filter=blob:none \
  --no-checkout \
  https://github.com/cirosantilli/test-git-partial-clone \
;
cd test-git-partial-clone
git checkout master -- d1
